# Logo Generator Challenge 10

## description
This is the 10th challenge for my bootcamp, making a logo generator using inquirer and SVG, and testing with Jest.

A lot of struggles that I had pertained to not being familiar with Jest, and also SVG. Also with the even projects, starting from scratch it is hard to find a starting point.

## testing
I used VSCode integrated terminal, npx jest to test the test files, and node index.js to test the inquirer prompt
